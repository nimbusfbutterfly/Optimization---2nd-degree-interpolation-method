# Optimization(2nd-degree-interpolation-method)
- For the following function, using the quadratic interpolation method, we need to find the optimal point with the condition that the lowest value of the function call should be between(10)^(-2) and (10)^(-8).
                                                                                              f(λ)=λ^5+3λ^2-2λe^0.5λ
